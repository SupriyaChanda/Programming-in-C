Problem:	2. This program is to make you appreciate the notion of correctness of an algorithm

there is three fils.

		quick.c	-	Program file
		input.txt	-	Input file
		output.txt-	Output file

I took 10 random numbers as a input.
I checked for correctness of the Partition (A, p, r)  procedure using the three test criteria.
I verify and shown all condition and correct output in output file.
Instead of "i" I took "yellow" and "j" I took "green"

I used three functions

	1. qsort()
	2. display()
	3. swap()
